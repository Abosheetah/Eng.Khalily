Process Performance Optimization 
On lint mutt-gas atmosphere monitoring pro-vides Realâ€¢Time process control previously unavailable for metal treating applications. Adding additional measurements of pressure and temperature during the heat treating cycle allows complete process understanding load-wig to improved product quality and batch consistency
Traditional heat treating processes measure up to three atmosphere gases (CO, CO2, and methane). The LOA measures up to eight gases resulting in complete process under-standing
